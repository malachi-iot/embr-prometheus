# Prometheus reporting for Embedded Devices

This lib supports revealing scrape data to the awesome https://prometheus.io/ and by extension https://grafana.com/

These are early days for the library!  Expect some glitches :)

Synthetic testing OK:

- C++ gcc on Debian
- esp-idf v5.0

Haven't run it through a proper prometheus server yet
